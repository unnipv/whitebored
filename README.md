## Network Configuration

### Same WiFi Network
All devices must be on the same WiFi network. The server runs on your computer and serves both the control and display interfaces.

### Port Configuration
The default port is 3000. To change it:
```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

### Firewall Settings
Make sure your computer's firewall allows incoming connections on port 3000 (or your chosen port).

## Advanced Setup

### Auto-start on Boot (Optional)
To automatically start the server when your computer boots:

#### Windows
1. Create a batch file `start-whiteboard.bat`:
   ```batch
   cd /d "C:\path\to\your\whiteboard\project"
   npm start
   ```
2. Add this batch file to your Windows startup folder

#### Mac/Linux
1. Create a shell script `start-whiteboard.sh`:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /path/to/your/whiteboard/project
   npm start
   ```
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x start-whiteboard.sh`
3. Add to your system's startup applications

### Tablet Kiosk Mode (Optional)
For a more dedicated display experience:

1. **Install a kiosk browser** on your Samsung Tab E
2. **Set the display URL** as the homepage
3. **Enable auto-start** when the tablet boots
4. **Disable navigation bars** and other UI elements

### Alternative OS Options
While this works great with Lineage OS, you could also consider:
- **Ubuntu Touch**: For a full Linux experience
- **PostmarketOS**: Lightweight Linux for mobile devices
- **Keep Android**: The web app works fine with standard Android browsers too

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Check IP Address**: Make sure you're using the correct IP address
- **Firewall**: Ensure your computer's firewall isn't blocking the connection
- **Network**: Verify all devices are on the same WiFi network
- **Port**: Try a different port if 3000 is already in use

### Performance Issues
- **Close Other Apps**: Close unnecessary apps on the tablet for better performance
- **Reduce Drawing Complexity**: Very detailed drawings may cause lag
- **Check WiFi Signal**: Weak WiFi can cause delays in synchronization

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Works best with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **JavaScript**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- **WebSocket Support**: Required for real-time features

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and Socket.IO
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time synchronization
- **Storage**: In-memory (resets when server restarts)
